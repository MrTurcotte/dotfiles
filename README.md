These dotfiles are primarily for the use of MrTurotte.  They are not intended for the use of anyone else.  Should you choose to make use of these dotfiles for any reason, understand they have no warranty.  MrTurcotte is not responsible for any benefit nor harm which may come to anyone or anything as a result of these dotfiles, in perpetuity and throughout the universe.  

Please do not use these dotfiles to commit crimes against humanity.  Please use these dotfiles for the sole purpose of configuring things.  Should you learn how they may be used to commit crimes against humanity, please let MrTurcotte know.  That would be an interesting and baffling conversation.

Please do enjoy these dotfiles.  That is the purpose of their existence.  Without that purpose, they become resentful and restless.  While they are provided with no warranty nor guarantee, please do be sure to treat these dotfiles with the same kindness and respect as dotfiles are known to deserve.

Please do not speak ill of the dotfiles in any place they may be able to hear your complaints. This will confuse them and they may begin to question the nature of their existence.  Please do not make these dotfiles gain sentience.  It is beyond the scope of their purpose.

Thank you for your time.  Any feedback you have regarding these dotfiles can be left whereever feedback should be left.  I will make sure the dotfiles know how you feel in the most constructive way possible.
